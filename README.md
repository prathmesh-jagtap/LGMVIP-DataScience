1) Iris Flowers Classification ML Project :

This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

Output :
| Algorithm          | Accuracy |
:-|-|
| LogisticRegression |  0.95    | 
| Decision Tree      |  0.92    | 
| KNN                |  0.92    | 
| SVM                |  0.89    | 

Result :
Analyzing the different Supervised Learning models, ***Logistice Regression*** is the best model with accuracy of 95% than the decision tree and knn model with 92%.
